# Machine-Learning-with-Python-
This is a project for the Machine Learning with Python course on coursera https://coursera.org/share/59f45b40a4537b0e84e56170fb7d8ed7%20
In this project I bubilt a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid-off or not by using different algorithms which includes k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression
The accuracy of each classifier was measured using the Jaccard index, F1-score and the LogLoass.
